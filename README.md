# AI Programming with Python Project

Image Classifier Project

Using PyTorch and transfer learning (e.g., VGG16), the model classifies flower images into categories with high accuracy. The project includes both a Jupyter notebook for development and command line scripts for training and prediction.

Features
Pretrained model with custom classifier
Data augmentation & normalization
GPU training support
Save/load model checkpoints
Command-line tools:
train.py for training and saving model
predict.py for predicting image classes
